## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

### When PixelLab MCP is Connected:
1. Generate each sprite using the prompts above
2. Save to `F:\Desktop\Ninja Slicer\public\assets\enemies\` directory
3. Use naming convention from original files (e.g., `zombie.png`, `zombie_sheet.png`)
4. For sprite sheets, render each frame separately, then combine horizontally
5. Downscale high-res renders to final size (256→64 or 512→128) for crisp pixel-perfect look

### File Naming Reference:
- **Zombie**: `zombie.png` (frame 0), `zombie_sheet.png` (4 frames horizontal), `zombie_left_half.png`, `zombie_right_half.png`
- **Vampire**: `vampire.png` (frame 0), `vampire_sheet.png` (4 frames), `vampire_left_half.png`, `vampire_right_half.png`, `vampire_bat.png`
- **Ghost**: `ghost.png` (frame 0), `ghost_sheet.png` (4 frames), optional `ghost_mist.png`
- **Bosses**: `[boss_name].png` (frame 0), `[boss_name]_sheet.png` (3 frames)
  - Example: `grave_titan.png`, `gravetitan_sheet.png`
  - Special: `horseman_head.png` for Headless Horseman projectile
  - Special: `demon_fire.png` for Demon Overlord particles

### Sprite Sheet Layout:
```
[Frame 0] [Frame 1] [Frame 2] [Frame 3]
```
All frames arranged horizontally in a single row, each frame at 64x64 (monsters) or 128x128 (bosses).

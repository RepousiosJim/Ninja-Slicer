=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Ninja Slicer - Basic Audio Integration
Workspace: F:\Desktop\Ninja Slicer
Started: 2025-12-31 07:22 UTC

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Adding audio capabilities to existing game events (slash, monster death, combo, UI clicks). AudioManager infrastructure already exists - this is an integration task, not building from scratch.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Conducted deep codebase investigation
- Discovered AudioManager.ts already exists with full SFX implementation
- Created implementation_plan.json with 7 phases, 9 subtasks
- Updated context.json with integration points
- Created init.sh for environment setup

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Audio Assets Setup): 1 subtask - Create directory structure and placeholder audio files
- Phase 2 (Audio Asset Loading): 1 subtask - Add audio loading to PreloaderScene
- Phase 3 (Slash Sound Integration): 1 subtask - Add swoosh sound to SlashSystem
- Phase 4 (Monster Death Sound Integration): 1 subtask - Add death sounds to Monster class
- Phase 5 (Combo Milestone Sound Integration): 1 subtask - Add combo sounds to ComboSystem
- Phase 6 (UI Button Click Sound Integration): 1 subtask - Add click sound to Button class
- Phase 7 (Audio System Integration & Verification): 2 subtasks - Wire AudioManager to GameplayScene, E2E verification

Services Involved:
- main: TypeScript/Phaser game application (single service project)

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 4 (phases 3-6 can run in parallel)
- Recommended workers: 1 (sequential execution for simpler coordination)
- Parallel groups:
  * Phases 3-6 (slash, monster, combo, UI audio) depend only on phase 2 and modify different files
- Speedup estimate: Parallelism possible but limited benefit for this single-service integration

Key Findings from Investigation:
- AudioManager.ts already implemented (src/managers/AudioManager.ts)
  * playSFX(key, config?) method for playing sounds
  * playRandomSFX(keys[]) for variations
  * playSFXWithVariation(key, pitchRange) for pitch variety
  * applySettings(settings) for loading from SaveManager
  * Already handles sfxEnabled toggle and sfxVolume
- SaveManager already has audio settings (sfxEnabled, sfxVolume, musicEnabled, musicVolume)
- Integration points identified:
  * SlashSystem: Trigger swoosh on slash detection
  * Monster.onSliced(): Trigger death sound by monster type
  * ComboSystem.increment(): Trigger milestone sounds at combo thresholds (5, 10, 15)
  * Button.onPress(): Trigger click sound on all button interactions
  * GameplayScene.create(): Initialize AudioManager and apply settings

Audio Assets Required:
- combat/swoosh.mp3 (slash sound)
- monsters/death_zombie.mp3 (zombie death)
- monsters/death_vampire.mp3 (vampire death)
- monsters/death_ghost.mp3 (ghost death)
- combo/milestone_low.mp3 (combo 5+)
- combo/milestone_medium.mp3 (combo 10+)
- combo/milestone_high.mp3 (combo 15+)
- ui/button_click.mp3 (UI feedback)

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===
